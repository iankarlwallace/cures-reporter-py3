# cures-reporter-py3
Cures Reporter and EMR Scrapping Tool Implemented in Python3
Hope is to take Excel spreadsheet as input and then construct:
1) Patient query list from the spreadsheet
2) Iterate over the list query Cures data
3) Scrap EMR data as possible for patient
4) Log in second spreadsheet to then be reported as study data

Was initially impleneted in Node.js
Migrating to python3 due to what appears to be better scripting
tool support for computer vision tools.
